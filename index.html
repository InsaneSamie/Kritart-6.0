    <h1>**Chaitre is what one makes feel better**</h1>
<p>Charity brings to life again those who are spiritually dead.</p>
<p>He who has never denied himself for the sake of giving, has but glanced at the joys of charity.</p>
<p>He who has no charity deserves no mercy.</p>
<p>Charity is injurious unless it helps the recipient to become independent of it.</p>

    <p>Your “good old days” are still ahead of you, may you have many of them.”</p>
